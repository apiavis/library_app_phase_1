# Library App Phase I
This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. It is the first part of a multi-phase project in which I create a full-stack library application.  

## Overview
Phase one of this project has a front-end built with HTML CSS and VanillaJS. The HTML and CSS was provided to me as boiler plate code. The project required me to use indexedDB for client-side storage, and I utilized a REST API to perform CRUD operations on books that came from a Cloud Firestore database stored on GCP. This phase did not require me to interact with the Firestore database directly, as the back-end was already built out. In addition, the basic outlines for some of the Classes were provided to me for guidance. This project involves object-oriented programming and classes that exhibit static methods.
